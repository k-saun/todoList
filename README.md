# React JS Todo List

## Overview
This repository is a practice project based on a JS React [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBws8MSXN7A) by Traversy Media.
It goes over JS concepts like classes, destructuring, high order array functions, arrow functions, Fetch APIs and more; and obviously 
aspect of the React library / framework such as React components, classes and functions, React routing, etc.

## Available Scripts

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
